## üé® Problem Solving Patterns

### üéØ **The 20 Most Important Patterns**

#### **1. Two Pointers**
**When to use**: Sorted arrays, palindromes, pair/triplet problems
```python
def two_sum_sorted(nums, target):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = nums[left] + nums[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left, right]
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return []

# Common variations:
# - Three sum, four sum
# - Container with most water
# - Remove duplicates from sorted array
# - Palindrome verification
```

#### **2. Sliding Window**
**When to use**: Subarray/substring problems, optimization problems
```python
def max_sum_subarray_size_k(arr, k):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    window_sum = 0
    window_start = 0
    
    for window_end in range(len(arr)):
        window_sum += arr[window_end]
        
        if window_end >= k - 1:
            max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)
            window_sum -= arr[window_start]
            window_start += 1
    
    return max_sum

# Common variations:
# - Longest substring without repeating characters
# - Minimum window substring
# - Maximum number of vowels in substring
# - Sliding window maximum
```

#### **3. Fast & Slow Pointers**
**When to use**: Cycle detection, middle element finding
```python
def has_cycle(head):
    slow = fast = head
    
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        
        if slow == fast:
            return True
    
    return False

# Common variations:
# - Find middle of linked list
# - Detect cycle start
# - Happy number problem
# - Palindrome linked list
```

#### **4. Merge Intervals**
**When to use**: Overlapping intervals, scheduling problems
```python
def merge_intervals(intervals):
    if not intervals:
        return []
    
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    merged = [intervals[0]]
    
    for current in intervals[1:]:
        last_merged = merged[-1]
        
        if current[0] <= last_merged[1]:
            merged[-1] = [last_merged[0], max(last_merged[1], current[1])]
        else:
            merged.append(current)
    
    return merged

# Common variations:
# - Insert interval
# - Non-overlapping intervals
# - Meeting rooms problems
# - Interval list intersections
```

#### **5. Cyclic Sort**
**When to use**: Arrays with numbers in given range, missing/duplicate numbers
```python
def cyclic_sort(nums):
    i = 0
    while i < len(nums):
        correct_index = nums[i] - 1
        if nums[i] != nums[correct_index]:
            nums[i], nums[correct_index] = nums[correct_index], nums[i]
        else:
            i += 1
    return nums

# Common variations:
# - Find missing number
# - Find duplicate number
# - Find all missing numbers
# - Find corrupt pair
```

    n = len(weights)
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(capacity + 1)] for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Initialize first row
    for c in range(capacity + 1):
        if weights[0] <= c:
            dp[0][c] = values[0]
    
    # Fill the rest of the table
    for i in range(1, n):
        for c in range(capacity + 1):
            profit1 = 0
            if weights[i] <= c:
                profit1 = values[i] + dp[i-1][c-weights[i]]
            
            profit2 = dp[i-1][c]
            dp[i][c] = max(profit1, profit2)
    
    return dp[n-1][capacity]

# Space optimized version
def knapsack_optimized(weights, values, capacity):
    dp = [0 for _ in range(capacity + 1)]
    
    for i in range(len(weights)):
        for c in range(capacity, weights[i] - 1, -1):
            dp[c] = max(dp[c], values[i] + dp[c - weights[i]])
    
    return dp[capacity]
```

#### **7. Unbounded Knapsack Pattern**
```python
def unbounded_knapsack(weights, values, capacity):
    dp = [0 for _ in range(capacity + 1)]
    
    for c in range(capacity + 1):
        for i in range(len(weights)):
            if weights[i] <= c:
                dp[c] = max(dp[c], values[i] + dp[c - weights[i]])
    
    return dp[capacity]

# Common variations:
# - Rod cutting problem
# - Coin change (minimum coins)
# - Coin change (number of ways)
# - Maximum ribbon cut
```

### üå≥ **Tree Patterns**

#### **8. Tree DFS Pattern**
```python
def tree_path_sum(root, target_sum):
    if not root:
        return False
    
    if not root.left and not root.right:
        return root.val == target_sum
    
    return (tree_path_sum(root.left, target_sum - root.val) or
            tree_path_sum(root.right, target_sum - root.val))

# Common variations:
# - All paths for a sum
# - Path with given sequence
# - Count paths with sum
# - Tree diameter
```

#### **9. Tree BFS Pattern**
```python
from collections import deque

def level_order_traversal(root):
    if not root:
        return []
    
    result = []
    queue = deque([root])
    
    while queue:
        level_size = len(queue)
        current_level = []
        
        for _ in range(level_size):
            node = queue.popleft()
            current_level.append(node.val)
            
            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)
